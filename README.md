üöÄ Codespaces features:

- Repeatable cloud environment offering a push-button experience.
- Can be configured and customized.
- Integrates with your repositories on GitHub and [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82023-juyooo).

As a teacher that means that you can create an environment, in the cloud, for your class that all students can use with zero or next to zero configuration regardless of what operating system they are using.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ What is GitHub Codespaces and how can I use it in my teaching?

A Codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud that you can configure. The Codespaces Education benefit gives Global Campus teachers a free monthly allowance of GitHub Codespaces hours to use in [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). Learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/using-github-codespaces-with-github-classroom) about Using GitHub Codespaces with GitHub Classroom.

If you are not already a Global Campus teacher, apply [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/pack_application) or for more information, see [Apply to GitHub Global Campus as a teacher](https://docs.github.com/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-teachers/apply-to-github-global-campus-as-a-teacher).

## üîç What is in this template?

This template repository contains:

- `.devcontainer` settings:
  - [`Dockerfile`](.devcontainer/Dockerfile): defines the devcontainer image for GitHub Codespaces that determines the operating system and .NET version.
  - [`devcontainer.json`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json): declares the devcontainer configuration for GitHub Codespaces including extensions and tools to be pre-installed, and workspace settings.
  - [`post-create.sh`](.devcontainer/post-create.sh): describes additional tools to be pre-installed.
- [ASP.NET web app](src/MyWebApp): A sample web app
- [ASP.NET API app](src/MyApiApp): A sample API app
- [`README`](README.md): _this file_ &ndash; describes this repository and what's in it.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Create a repository from this template. Use this [create repo link](../../generate). You can make the repository private or public, up to you.
1. Navigate to the main page of the newly created repository.
1. Under the repository name, use the Code drop-down menu, and in the Codespaces tab, select "Create codespace on main".

   ![Create codespace](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-138303/images/help/codespaces/new-codespace-button.png)

1. Wait as Github initializes the codespace:

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

Customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable Codespaces configuration for all users of your project.

You can configure things like:

- Extensions, you can specify what extensions should be preinstalled.
- Dotfiles and settings.
- Operating system libraries and dependencies

### Customization on `devcontainer.json`

#### Base Image

By default, this devcontainer settings uses the base image of **.NET 7.0 on Debian 11** by default. You can change the base image to [one in the list](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-sdk/).

```jsonc
"build": {
  "dockerfile": "./Dockerfile",
  "context": ".",
  "args": {
    "VARIANT": "7.0"
  }
}
```

#### Features

1. **Azure CLI**: Uncomment the section under the `features` attribute.

    ```jsonc
    "features": {
      ...
      "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/azure-cli:1": {
        "version": "latest"
      }
      ...
    },
    ```

1. **GitHub CLI**: Uncomment the section under the `features` attribute.

    ```jsonc
    "features": {
      ...
      "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {
        "version": "latest"
      }
      ...
    },
    ```

1. **node.js**: Uncomment the section under the `features` attribute. The latest LTS version of node.js is chosen by default.

    ```jsonc
    "features": {
      ...
      "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/node:1": {
        "version": "lts",
        "nodeGypDependencies": true,
        "nvmInstallPath": "/usr/local/share/nvm"
      }
      ...
    },
    ```

> üîç If you want to add more features, find [this repository: devcontainer features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features).


#### Extensions

1. There are optional extensions pre-installed under the `customizations.vscode.extensions` attribute.

    ```jsonc
    "customizations": {
      "vscode": {
        "extensions": [
          "ms-dotnettools.csharp",
          "ms-vscode.PowerShell",
          "ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack",
          "VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode"
        ],
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

> üîç Alternatively, you can add as many extra extensions as you like, from [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).


### Customization on `post-create.sh` ##

You can pre-install any tool through `post-create.sh`, which the devcontainer features don't natively support yet. eg) PowerShell.

1. If you want to install oh-my-posh for PowerShell, uncomment the section below

    ```bash
    ## OH-MY-POSH ##
    # Uncomment the below to install oh-my-posh
    sudo wget https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/releases/latest/download/posh-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/oh-my-posh
    ```

> üîç There are more customization scenarios in [`post-create.sh`](./.devcontainer/post-create.sh), if you like to follow.
